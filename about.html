	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p class="intro"> Hi there I am Racheal.An old soul who loves vintage and art. Growing up I always knew I had a curious mind and a creative one at that. I have always perceived programming as an immensely difficult career path.I did a completely different course in campus. I graduated and worked in a cool company that was filled with great programmers whose work was very fascinating to say the least. My interest grew ever since and I knew i wanted to learn code. So far Moringa has given me exactly what I had imagined ;). It just feels so natural I couldn't be wrong!.</p>
