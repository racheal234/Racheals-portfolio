	<h2 class="panel titile">About Wambui</h2>
	<p class="intro"> I am an old soul.I love vintage and art. Since I was a litte girl I always knew I had a curious mind and a creative one at that. I have always perceived programming as an immensely difficult career path.I did a completely different course in campus. I graduated and worked in a cool company that was filled with great programmers whose work was very fascinating to say the least. My interest grew ever since and I knew i wanted to learn code. So far Moringa has given me exactly what I had imagined ;). It just feels so natural I couldn't be wrong!.</p>
